                    Although chillies are a beloved Thai ingredient and used intensively, they, too, are not native to the
                region, but are introduced from the Americas. Thai cuisine cannot even lay claim on its most essential
                flavoring ingredient – fish sauce, which really has roots in Mediterranean cuisine. The ancient Romans
                cherished this salty extract of anchovies and doused a wide variety of dishes with its flavor and aroma.
                Aside from these notable examples, there are numerous other foreign ingredients, as well as styles of
                cooking, which have been absorbed into the cuisines of Southeast Asia. <span>Thai food is already “fusion
                food”</span> and is what it is not because of the individual ingredients, but because of the particular flavor
                balances that set the cuisine apart from others.
            </p></br>
            <p class="description">
                Owing to the country’s auspicious location and her people’s openness, Thai cuisine has seen tremendous 
                changes over the past few centuries. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, booming international 
                maritime trade brought a host of flavor ingredients and cooking styles from around the world, 
                many of which made their way into Thai cooking via the nobility.

                On their long, circuitous journey, merchant ships sailing between India, the Spice Islands of the Indonesian 
                archipelago and China would stop by the fabled ports of Ayuthaya in the kingdom then known as Siam. 
                Ayuthaya was an amphibious city, situated on an island formed by the confluence of three rivers, 
                and in its heyday supported a population of over a million, most of whom lived on houseboats along 
                the rivers and their many tributaries. It was a glittering, very cosmopolitan and international city, 
                described by some awed travelers as even more glorious than London and Paris of its day.
            </p></br>
            <p class="description">
                More than forty nationalities at one time or another resided here, many occupying their own quarters in the city with their own docks. 
                They brought with them ways of cooking from their homeland. Those involved in international commerce 
                traded the spices and foodstuffs they carried on their ships. There was a great exchange of culinary 
                delights and many new and unusual ingredients found their way into Siamese kitchens to be given a distinctly 
                new identity.
